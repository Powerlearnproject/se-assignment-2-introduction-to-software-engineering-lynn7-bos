# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
This is the application of engineering principles to build a software that is reliable, efficient and maintenable

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? Traditional programming focuses on solving specific problems using a code.On the other hand,software engineeering involves a wholistic approach where it focuses on the entire software development cycle from initial concept to maintenance
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):Requirements,Design,Implemetation,Testing,Deployment, Maintenamce

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Requirements-Defining the project goals,Identifying audience
Design-Software architecture/outlook is designed
Implementation- Involves writing code,creating unit tests and intergrating the software
Testing-Software is tested and bug are fixed
Deployment-Releasing of software to target audeince/users
Maintenance- Involves fixing bugs,adding new features based on changing demands of audience

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?Agile models allow for flexibility but Waterfall models take things step by step.Waterfall models are more appropriate in short term projects while agile models are appropriate in long term projects

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering?
It is understanding what the software needs to do to meet the needs of its users and stakeholders

Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
it involves gathering, analyzing, documenting and verifying the requiremnts for a software system.This is part of maintenance and ensure that the software still stay part of the market

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. 
This is where a complex software system is broken down into smaller self contained units called modules designed to perform specific tasks
How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems? It reduces complexity and improves manaegability

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). 
Unit testing-Focuses on individual units of code like modules.Used by designers to verify the correctness of their codes
Intergration testing- is where different software units work together to ensure that these units can collaborate to achieve the desired result
System testing-is where the entire system is tested to ensure it meets all functional and nonfunctional requrements
Acceptance testing is where the software is now tested by stakeholders and endusers to ensure it meets their needs and expectations

Why is testing crucial in software development?For ensure all goals are met for the specific software and identify problems from the unit level 
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version control systems are tools which help in managing and tracking changes to cose over time during software dvelopment.They are important to track modifications made to codes and understanding evolution of code base.Also helps in security as only authorised developers can modify the code
Popular vcs include:Git which is widely used in open source projects

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
A software project manager is a team leader motivating and mentoring the team
Helps in facilitating communication within the team
Oversees the entire software development cycle

Challenges include;Meeting deadlines and budgets, Motivating and retaing talent and staying upto date with technology
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software maintenance is an ongoing effort to ensure the software continues to function correctly,meet users needs and adapt to changes in the environments
It involves  fixing bugs and errors, enhancing the softwares functionality and performance,Modifying software to accomodate changes in the operating system and restructuring and refactrrong the code to prevent future problems.
It is important to ensure functionality and security
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Violation of user's data privacy
Software vulnerabilities can leave users and systems exposed to cyberattacks
Some software is designed to be addictive potentially harming users wellbeing
They can ensure they adhere to ethical standards by prioritizing user wellbeing,Being transparent on how software works and data is collected and used


Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
